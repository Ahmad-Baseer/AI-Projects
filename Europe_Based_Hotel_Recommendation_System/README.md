# How to run the web application


### Follow the steps to configure this application:

1. Download all the files and place these in a specific folder. Open up jupyter notebook in that folder.
2. Install the libraries first before running notebooks. Remove the '#' sign from the lines to allow nltk to download required files & to see if everything works fine or not.
3. Download the Hotel Reviews dataset from this link: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe"
4. Run the 'Hotel_Recommendation_System' file first and then 'Hotel Recommendation System Web App', after running the second one you should see this: 'Overwriting Web_App.py' in output.
5. Open up the terminal in the same folder and type this command: 'streamlit run Web_App.py'. It will open your application in your default browser.
6. Now you can follow any youtube video to deploy this application.
